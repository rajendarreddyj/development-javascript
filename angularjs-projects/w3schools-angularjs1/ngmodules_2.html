An AngularJS module defines an application.
The module is a container for the different parts of an application.
The module is a container for the application controllers.
Controllers always belong to a module.

<body>

    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
        {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
    </div>
    <!--"myApp.js" contains an application module definition, while "myCtrl.js" contains the controller-->
    <script src="myApp.js"></script>
    <script src="myCtrl.js"></script>
    <!--
    A common advice for HTML applications, is to place scripts at the very bottom of the <body> element.
    But, in many AngularJS examples, you will see the library in the head of the document.
    This is because calls to angular.module can only be compiled after the library has been loaded.
    Another solution is to load the AngularJS library in the <body> element, before your own AngularJS scripts:
